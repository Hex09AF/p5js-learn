## 18.1: Introduction to WebGL in p5.js

- `createCanvas(,,WEBGL)`

## 18.2: 3D Geometries

- Box, Translate, Rotate

## 18.3: Light and Material

- Ambient, pointLight
- basicMaterial (`fill` material with basic color)
- normalMaterial
- specularMaterial
- createVector, normalize

## 18.4: Texture 

- shadow and texture
- `texture` (camera texture =))))) lol )
- `plane` (flat surface)

## 18.5: Camera and Perspective

- `camera`
- `perspective` (This projection represents depth through foreshortening: objects that are close to the camera appear their actual size while those that are further away from the camera appear smaller)
- qbert
- `ortho` (In this projection, all objects with the same dimension appear the same size, regardless of whether they are near or far from the camera)

## 18.6: createGraphics() as WebGL Texture

- `createGraphics()` be careful the background is transparent (default)
- draw text using graphic
